              </div>
              <div>
                  <h4>Random overworld map generation</h4>
                  <p>A new overworld map is generated with each seed. Checks are used to make
                  sure all towns and caves are accessible. On generated maps, the Rainbow Drop
                  is used just outside Charlock to create a bridge over the moat.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h4>Random chest contents</h4>
                  <p>Chest contents throughout the game are randomized. Checks are used to ensure that
                  quest items (Staff of Rain, Silver Harp, Stones of Sunlight) are not located in 
                  Charlock castle. Erdrick&#39;s Tablet is removed.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h4>Random enemy attack patterns</h4>
                  <p>This will give some enemies spells they did not originally have. This means you
                  could have a Red Slime with SLEEP, a Wizard with Fire Breath, or any other 
                  combination!</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h4>Random enemy zones</h4>
                  <p>The locations of enemies will be changed. Randomizer ensures that enemies near
                  Tantegel Castle are not too tough to defeat at low levels, but beyond that,
                  anything goes.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h4>Random enemy stats, XP, and gold</h4>
                  <p>Enemy statisics (strength, agility, HP) can be randomized, as can the amount of
                  gold and experience you receive from them.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h4>Boosted XP/gold drops</h4>
                  <p>Enemies will now give you more XP and Gold, in line with the SNES remake of the
                  game. XP and gold drops are limited to 255 due to game engine limitations.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h4>Lower MP requirements</h4>
                  <p>MP requirements for spells are adjusted to be the same as those in the remake.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h4>Random weapon shops</h4>
                  <p>Weapon shop inventory will now be random. Every shop will have 5-6 random items.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h4>Random XP requirements</h4>
                  <p>Experience requirements to obtain a new level can be randomized.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h4>Random weapon prices</h4>
                  <p>Weapon prices can be randomized. This does not affect their capability.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h4>Shuffled &quot;searched for&quot; items</h4>
                  <p>The Fairy Flute, Erdrick&#39;s Armor, and Erdrick&#39;s Token will now be shuffled, so
                  for example the token could be in Kol instead of the flute, and the armor on the
                  overworld. Erdrick&#39;s Token or the Flute could also be in a random chest instead
                  of on the ground. In addition, the item&#39;s location on the overworld is random. The
                  NPC in Cantlin can tell you where it is.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h4>Randomized player attributes</h4>
                  <p>Your character&#39;s Strength, Agility, HP and MP are randomly generated.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h4>Randomized spell learning</h4>
                  <p>Spells learning is now randomized. Any spell can be learned anywhere from level 1 to
                  level 16.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h4>Buffed HEAL and HURT</h4>
                  <p>The HEAL spell has a range from 17-25. The HURT spell has a range from 9-16.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h4>Faster leveling</h4>
                  <p>The number of experience points required for level ups can be adjusted with the
                  fast leveling and very fast leveling options. These require 75% and 50% of the 
                  normal requirements for the game, respectively.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h4>Cursed Princess mode</h4>
                  <p>Get Princess Gwaelin to take a cursed belt from your inventory when you bring
                  her to the king to win the game. The game can also still be completed in the
                  normal manner.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h4>Three&#39;s Company mode</h4>
                  <p>Bring Princess Gwaelin to the Dragonlord and agree to join him in ruling the
                  world to win in this mode. The game can also still be completed in the normal
                  manner.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h4>Alternate player sprites</h4>
                  <p>Over 80 alternate sprites to choose from for the main character.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h4>Other changes</h4>
                  <p>The Death Necklace is always available in a chest. Putting it on gives you 
                  +10 attack power at the cost of 25% of your max HP and being cursed. The
                  Fighter&#39;s Ring works (+2 ATK). Other options include faster text, open Charlock
                  (no Rainbow Drop required) shortened Charlock dungeon, disabling magic keys, 
                  or more swamp on the overworld.</p>
